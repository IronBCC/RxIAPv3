# RxIAPv3
Android In-App Billing Library which provides several Rx Methods for Purchasing, Consuming and Listing Products
Based on the initial work of Anjlab (https://github.com/anjlab/android-inapp-billing-v3).

This library provides the existing functionality of Anjlab's initial work and as well a lot of helper methods that let you extract more information on the workflow of a purchase or a consume. It also uses Hawk (https://github.com/orhanobut/hawk) for the needs of caching products purchased and data of the purchases. 

This project is open to a lot of modifications to be better. I will try fixing a lot of things as the time goes by. I am also open to any pull request that can help the project :)
